Drop JSON theme files generated by the Apache echarts-theme-builder here.

How to generate a theme using the echarts-theme-builder:

1. Install the builder (node/npm required):
   - git clone https://github.com/apache/echarts-theme-builder.git
   - cd echarts-theme-builder
   - npm install

2. Run the build tool to create a theme JSON. See the project's README for commands.

3. Copy the generated .json file into this `themes/` folder or upload it via the dashboard sidebar.

4. In the Dashboard Builder sidebar, select the theme from the "ECharts Themes" section. The selected theme will be applied to charts.

Notes:
- The dashboard will validate uploaded JSON before saving. Invalid JSON will be rejected.
- The PDF exporter uses Matplotlib for charts so export visuals are simplified and may not exactly match ECharts visuals.
